# BRUTEFORCING-A-PRNG-IN-RUST



This is a CTF challenge on hacker101.com so if you wish to not get spoilered please look elsewhere. Initially i used python's multiprocessing
library for the job but it took way longer than expected. With the help of Rayon which is a paralelization library and Rust, We brute-forced
the initial seed in 20mins on a dual core CPU.
